all code is for the mcu..
---

howto setup:
- plugin an esp8266 dev board (eg. Adafruit Feather HUZZAH or similar) to a computer via USB 
- Make sure driver for serial comms (and software for serial terminal) is installed on computer. Default Arduino stuff works for this.
- connect ESP8266 to the laundry card:
	D1=CS
	D2=DI
	D3=DO
	D4=SK
	5v=VCC
	GND=GND (lol)
- install code to ESP using arduino IDE
- then reboot ESP and open serial terminal

howto use:
1. open uart connection
   baud=9600UL
2. follow instructions
3. ???
4. profit!
